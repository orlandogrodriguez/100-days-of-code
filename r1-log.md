## Log

### R1D1 - January 2, 2018
I had already started the 100 days of code challenge, but today I forked the official repository for the challenge and I'm finally adhering to the official rules. Also, I started the project I was working on from scratch. I started working on a simple iOS project I've been meaning to work on for some time now. It's titled "Swayter". This is going to be a simple app that sends its users notifications stating how many layers to wear on a given day. This will be determined by the thresholds set up by the user.

Today, I created the TemperatureThreshold object description. I'll probably make some changes to it, but I'm going to wrap it up for the day. I'm looking forward to tomorrow!
